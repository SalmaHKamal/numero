Numero is a game that displays a number and a [Roman numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals). The player must choose whether or not the Roman numeral is the correct representation of the number. After making a choice, the game displays the next set of numbers. The game ends after ten attempts, at which point the player can restart the game.
